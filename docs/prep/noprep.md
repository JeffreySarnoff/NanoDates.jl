Julia's DateTime type is limited to milliseconds, while the Time type supports nanoseconds.  This talk introduces the NanoDate type, which works as a higher precision version of DateTime.
Broader support for CompoundPeriods helps developers; fuller handling of floor, ceil and NanoDate type interoperability keeps ease of use and augments flexibility.

We cover best practice with NanoDates and show they are ready to assist, and interoperate with the Dates.jl
