## Application Notes

##### NanoDates put Nanoseconds into timekeeping

- produce, consume, transmit microtimed occurrences
- design using nanosecond resolved records
- capable, conformant timestamping

-----

##### Financial Market Operations
 
In 2018 financial centers, through host countries, adopted regulations for participants in high frequency trading.
 
- Market events and order transactions must be recorded and retraceable to UTC (Universal Coordinated Time).
 
- Systems that are synchronized to a [validated] clock, require timestamp availability at submillisecond resolutions. The shortest interval [required of] very high frequency trading work is 25 ns (2022),
