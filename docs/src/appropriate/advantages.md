## Appealing Advantages

**NanoDate` just works .. well with many, many Julia packages.**

- Are your resources more capable than `DateTime` understands?
- Do you produce, consume, or otherwise ferry microtimed occurances?
- Is your masterful realtime design standing by as the nanoseconds fly?

-----

- NanoDates are your fuller realization of dates-with-times.
- Each NanoDate is con*struct*ed into the temporal context given.
  - that makes them strongly continumm localic, 
    - where "near" and "far" are merely *here* and *there*
