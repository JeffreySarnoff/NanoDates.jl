- capable, conformant timestamping

##### Financial Market Operations
 
In 2018 finanical centers, through host countries, adopted regulations for participants in high frequency trading. Here are quotes from two regulators:
 
 Market events and order transactions must be recorded and retraceable to UTC.
 
 Systems that are syncronized to a [validated] clock, require timestamp availability at submillisecond resolutions. The shortest interval [required of] very high frequncy trading work as of 2022-Jun-01 is 25 ns. 



*UTC is the timebase of record by international agreement and statutory law.*
