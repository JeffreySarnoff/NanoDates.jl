## Appealing Advantages

**NanoDates just work; they play well with Julia packages.**

- Are your resources more capable than `DateTime` understands?
- Do you produce, consume, or otherwise ferry microtimed occurances?
- Is your masterful realtime design standing by as the nanoseconds fly?

-----

- NanoDates are your fuller realization of dates-with-times.
- Each NanoDate is con*struct*ed into the temporal context given.
    - that makes them strongly continumm localic 
    - "near" and "far" become as *here* and *there*

In 2018 finanical centers, through their host countries, adopted regulations that apply to organizations and individuals participating in the high frequency  trade-by-trade flow that gives rise to market microdynamics. Here are two quotes from the regulators:
 
 Market events and order transactions must be recorded
 [and] retraceable to UTC.
 
 Systems that are syncronized to a [validated network] clock, require timestamp availability at submillisecond resolutions. The shortest interval that is required of very high frequncy trading work is 25ns. 

----

The UTC clock "ticks" smoothly (leap-seconds aside). That does not mean that these ticks are uniform.  The rotation of Earth and other planetary scale events make predicting UTC an inexact science. If you want to know what time it is, wait a while and that information will become available.
