##### Financial Market Operations
 
In 2018 finanical centers, through their host countries, adopted regulations that apply to organizations and individuals participating in the high frequency  trade-by-trade flow that gives rise to market microdynamics. Here are two quotes from the 2018 regulators:
 
 Market events and order transactions must be recorded
 [and] retraceable to UTC.
 
 Systems that are syncronized to a [validated network] clock, require timestamp availability at submillisecond resolutions. The shortest interval that is required of very high frequncy trading work by regulations as of 2022-Jun-01 is 25ns. 



*UTC is the timebase of record for statutory purposes and for most people as a shared convienience.*
