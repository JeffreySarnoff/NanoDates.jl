### Temporal periods, two ways

All of the TimePeriod and the DatePeriod types are found in two distinct contexts. They are most familiar participating in specific clock and calendar designations.
 
- "Next year, school starts on Jan 4 at 9:15."

That way of working with temporal periods relies on the attachment of periods to eventualities. Their other role occurs in a creative, rather than a descriptive context.  Periods exent, available and able, unfettered, nonassociated.

- "It takes me several hours to measure an attosecond."

That is the justification for holding extra nanoseconds.


----
    
**clock and calendar** is thier presence and utilization As free periods, periods not attached to a specific Time or any given Date, Nanoseconds are allowed to hold type to hold quantities exceeding their own field rollover count (the next nanosecond after the 999th carries all 1_000 of them into a single microsecond). And that lets us keep our struct to two fields while covering all Days of each Year one Nanosecond at a time.
